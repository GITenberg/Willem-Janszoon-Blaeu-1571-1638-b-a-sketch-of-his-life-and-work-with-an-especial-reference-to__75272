WORLD MAP OF 1605
</p>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>ILLEM JANSZOON BLAEU, one of
Holland’s most distinguished map and globe
makers of the early seventeenth century, was
born at the village of Alkmaar in the year 1571; such is
the record which finds general acceptance.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Of his childhood nothing is known. It was some time in
his early boyhood days that he went to Amsterdam, where
he found employment, it appears at first, in the house of a
Holland merchant, and later as a joiner’s apprentice. We
can be certain neither of the time when he decided to leave
Amsterdam, nor of the circumstances which induced him to
visit the island of Hveen, then belonging to Denmark,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> an
event of much significance in his life. We, however, cannot
be far wrong in asserting the promptings for this visit
to have been his early liking for mathematical, geographical
and astronomical studies. On this island he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
brought into intimate relations with Tycho Brahe, the
famous Danish astronomer, who, in 1576, established here
his observatory at the Castle of Uranienburg.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> For near a
quarter of a century, this was one of the most famous centers
in all Europe for the study of astronomical science and
of its practical applications. Blaeu, let it be noted, was
not the first of the young Netherlanders who found his way
to Uranienburg that he might receive astronomical instructions
from the great master. As early as 1591, Jacob
Florent van Langren of Amsterdam sent his son Arnold
to the Danish astronomer with a request that he might be
allowed to copy the catalogue of the stars which had been
located at his observatory, wishing to make use of the same
in the new celestial globes which he proposed to construct.
This special request, we are informed, was not granted,
for Brahe’s records were not yet complete, but young van
Langren was given permission to see the large celestial
globe which was in the observatory, and on which at the
time of the visit 800 stars had been represented.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> It is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>stated that Tycho often had as many as ten or twelve boys
at his observatory as his assistants.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="f3">

</a>
<p class="caption">Island of Hveen, showing the location of Uranienburg. From Le Grand Atlas</p>
<p class="caption3">click image to enlarge</p>
</div>

<p>We have but little direct information concerning Blaeu’s
sojourn at Uranienburg. It appears certain that he passed
at least two years with Brahe, engaged the while in study
and in the construction of mathematical and astronomical
instruments. May 21, 1596, the day of the young Hollander’s
departure for his native land, Brahe made the following
entry in his day-book, which book may be found in the
Imperial Library of Vienna, “Abiit domum in Hollandiam,
Vilhelmus Batavius cum per integram hyemen his
fuisset,” and by Gassendi we are told that Guilielmus
Janssonius had been with Tycho for two years, although
he does not make it certain that it was for two consecutive
years. That the relations between the two distinguished
scientists continued to be of the most friendly character
long after the date given above is very certain, as not a few
of those who in later years in praising Blaeu’s scientific
attainments refer to him as “the pupil and longtime friend
of Brahe,” yet neither of them appears in his writings to
have made more than a passing allusion to their relations.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>It cannot be doubted that Blaeu owed to his abode on
the island of Hveen the real foundation of his scientific
knowledge, both in the field of geography and of astronomy,
as well as his knowledge of the construction and the
skilful use of mathematical instruments. We have reason
for believing that a number of the instruments which
served the great astronomer in his investigations, were the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
work of Blaeu, and it is an interesting fact, as we know,
that Brahe’s observations, here made, formed the basis for
Kepler’s calculations, leading him to the discovery of the
laws which immortalized his name.</p>

<p>It was perhaps late in the year 1596, or early in 1597,
that Blaeu returned to Amsterdam where he soon established
himself as a maker of mathematical instruments, of
maps and of globes, and as an engraver and printer.</p>

<p>Before the close of the seventeenth century, the Netherlands
had moved into the first rank of European states in
which the art of engraving and of printing flourished.
Nothing perhaps contributed more to this end, especially
in the north, than the freedom which there prevailed untrammeled
by the restraints of the Index.</p>

<p>As for the particular art of map engraving and map
printing, the work of Mercator, of Ortelius, of Waghenaer,
had centered the attention of those interested in this
field upon the Low Countries. As early as 1541, not to
mention his work of the preceding decade, Mercator issued
his terrestrial globe gores, which mark a decided advance
in the art of map engraving, and this was followed by his
large map of England, of Europe, and of the World, the
latter setting forth the new method of projection since
known as Mercator’s projection. Ortelius’s great work of
1570, with its numerous succeeding issues, Waghenaer’s
Mirror of Navigation of 1585, and Mercator’s book of
maps of 1585, for which collection as a title the name Atlas
was first used, were superior productions, models for those
who followed closely within the same field.</p>

<p>Blaeu acknowledged these men to be his masters, though,
as was also frequently the case with other map makers and
map engravers of his day, he occasionally forgot to assign<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
proper credit to those from whom he borrowed in the cartographical
work that issued from his press.</p>

<p>We are told that Tycho had given to Blaeu a copy of
his astronomical observations before their publication,
that this copy was carried to Amsterdam, and that on the
record contained therein the latter began the practice of
globe making. The implication contained in this reference
is that his first work as a globe maker was the preparation
of material for a celestial globe, but no such globe of
his is known bearing date earlier than 1602. His first
dated work appears to have been a terrestrial globe of the
year 1599. It was as a maker and vender of mathematical
instruments, as a collector and close student of maps geographical
and astronomical, he probably found his chief
employment during the first years after his return to the
Netherlands. There is good reason for thinking that from
the first he prospered in his undertakings, and that he was
soon in a position to establish an independent business. It
may be inferred from incidental references that it was not
long after 1600 he was in his own fully equipped house
engaged in the business of engraving and printing.</p>

<p>Blaeu seems not to have become a member of any of the
guilds in his adopted city, and we, therefore, cannot turn
to their records for any information concerning his activities.
His name first publicly appears in the records of the
States General for the year 1605, in a resolution proposing
that a sum of money should be granted to him for printing
and publishing a <span class="smcap">Nieuw Graetbouck</span>, a name given at
that time in the Netherlands to a book containing declination
tables. This resolution reads as follows: “19 Maart
1605. Is Willem Jansz Blaeu tot Amsterdam geaccordeert
octroy, omme voor den tyt van 6 jaren naestcomende<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
alleene in de vereenichde provincien in druck vuyt to geven
een bouxken, geintituleert: Nieuw graetbouck, nae den
ouden styl vuyt de aldercorrecste observatien van den vermaerden
astronomo Tycho Brahe, gecalculeert ende gestelt
op ten meridiaen deser Nederlanden, enz.”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> A copy
of this work does not appear to be extant, but we may be
able, as Baudet suggests, to obtain something of an idea
of its character from later publications of Blaeu, as for
instance from his “Licht der Zeevaert.”</p>

<p>On his “Paescarte,” one of his early publications, and
usually referred to the year 1606, we read that it was “Ghedruckt
t’ Amsterdam bij Willem Janssoon op’t Waeter
inde Sonnewijser,” a location often referred to in certain
later publications as “op’ t water In de vergulde Sonnewyser,”
reference being to the gilded sun-dial which as a
business sign adorned the gable of his establishment.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> It
appears that in this originally selected locality his work
was carried on until the year 1637, when his entire plant
was moved into more commodious quarters in the Blumengracht,
one year only before his death. On the death of
Willem Blaeu, in 1638, the business passed into the hands
of his sons John and Cornelius Blaeu. In 1672 practically
the entire establishment was destroyed by fire.</p>

<p class="caption">PRESS INVENTED BY BLAEW.</p>
<p class="caption">From Johnson, J. Typographia</p>
</div>

<p>For his ability and attainments as a practical printer
Willem Blaeu is especially entitled to great honor. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>labored on for many years in Amsterdam, making use of
such presses as were commonly to be found in the printing
houses of his own and of other lands. Finding, however,
numerous inconveniences attending the structure of these
oldtime presses, he was induced, about 1620, to contrive
remedies.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> In this, we are told, he succeeded beyond his
expectations, so much indeed that he had nine of the new
presses constructed, each of which he called by the name
of one of the Muses. The excellence of Blaeu’s improvements
soon becoming known to other printing houses, their
proprietors were induced to follow his example, and presses
of his design became, in the course of a few years, almost
general throughout the Low Countries, and were introduced
into England, though at first there was here much
opposition to his new ideas. While the description below
is that of the Blaeu establishment as it was under the management
of the son John, yet as it presents to us the printing
house founded by the father, Willem Blaeu, and
describes a printing house of the middle of the seventeenth
century, it is here cited in free translation.</p>

<p>“On the Blumengracht,” says Filips von Zesen, in his
description of the city of Amsterdam,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> “near the third
bridge, and the third alley, may be found the greatly renowned
printing house of John Blaeu, Counsellor and
Magistrate, of this city. It is furnished with nine type
presses, named after the nine Muses, six presses for copperplate
printing, and a type foundry. The entire establishment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
on the canal, with the adjoining house, in which the
proprietor lives, is 75 feet in breadth, and stretches along
the east side of a cross street 135 feet, or with the attached
house 150 feet. Fronting on the canal is a room with cases
in which the copper plates are kept, from which the Atlases,
the Book of the Cities of the Netherlands and of foreign
countries, also the Mariners’ Atlases and other choice books
are printed, and which must have cost a ton of gold. Next
to this first room is a press room used for plate printing,
and opening upon the cross street referred to above is a
place where the type, from which impressions have been
made, are washed; then follows in order the room for book
printing, which resembles a long hall with numerous windows
on either side. In the extreme rear is a room in
which the type and certain other materials used in printing
are stored. Opposite this store room is a stairway leading
to a small room above which is set apart for the use of the
proof-readers, where first and second impressions are carefully
looked over, and the errors corrected which have been
made by the typesetters. In front of this last designated
room is a long table or bench on which the final prints are
placed as soon as they are brought from the press, and
where they are left for a considerable time. In the story
above is a table for the same purpose just indicated, at the
extreme end of which, and over the room occupied by the
proof-readers, is the type foundry wherein the letters used
in the printing of the various languages are moulded.</p>

<p>The foundation of this splendid building was laid in the
year 1636, by John Blaeu’s oldest son Willem Blaeu,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
and on the 13th of the fall month of the following year the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
printing establishment was here set in order. The original
founder of the printing house, who died in the following
year, was John Blaeu’s art loving father Willem, who, for
a considerable time, had been a pupil of the great astronomer
Tycho Brahe, whom he zealously followed, constructing
many instruments for the advancement of astronomical
studies, for the promotion of the art of navigation, and of
other sciences of like character, an interest in all of which
he revived and furthered while at the same time he made
new discoveries, as has become widely known from the
publications which have issued from this printing house.</p>

<p>But why should we here give to them such unbounded
praise? Since father and son without eulogy from us are so
well known to the entire learned world, to which they have
presented such treasures of inestimable value through their
incomparable pains and at great cost, and are so far advanced
on the road to immortality, it is more becoming in
us to remain silent than to speak further concerning them.”</p>

<p>Before turning for a reference more in detail to the publications
which were issued by the Blaeu press, to a consideration
of Willem Blaeu’s most important work as
engraver, as globe maker, as printer and publisher of maps
and navigators’ charts, a further brief word may be said
touching certain general interests and activities of his,
touching certain personal relations and individual characteristics,
which support the conclusion that he was a man
justly held in the highest esteem by men of science of his
day, and that he was interested in whatever pertained to
his great field of study.</p>

<p>Reference has been made to Blaeu’s ability as a maker
of mathematical and astronomical instruments, which work
claimed more or less of his attention to the end of his days.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
The fact, however, is a very remarkable one that from the
many years of activity as an instrument maker with Tycho
Brahe, and independently at Amsterdam, but one example
of his should have come down to us. Vossius says that “no
other scholar ever deserved so much praise as Blaeu on account
of an extraordinary and beautiful quadrant, which
can be seen at Leyden in the tower, where astronomical
observations are being made.”<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> His reference is to a quadrant
now kept in the Leyden Observatory. It is described
by Kayser in his Annals of the Observatory as a wooden
quadrant, with a brass rim, having a radius of seven feet.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
In the year 1632 it was purchased from the estate of Willebrod
Snellius, and may be said to have induced the founding
of this observatory in the year 1633.</p>

<p>With the conscientious map makers the problem was
ever present, how shall accuracy in space relations, accuracy
in location of places on the map be attained. Ptolemy
had been a guide in the earlier years of great geographical
discoveries and explorations, but geographical knowledge
soon extended to regions beyond those known to Ptolemy,
and the inaccuracies of his records, even for those regions
more or less familiar to the ancients, became very apparent.
In the maps of the seventeenth century we have interestingly
exhibited the tortuous advance of geographical
knowledge. They do not show a steady and continuous
progress toward accuracy. Information which may have
been accepted as truth respecting certain regions or geographical
areas, and have been recorded as such by one or
by many of the map makers, would often be held as doubtful
by those of succeeding years, to be accepted and
rejected again in turn. Blaeu’s intimate acquaintance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
with mathematics and astronomy as related to geography,
particularly as related to cartography, admirably fitted
him for a certain leadership in this field. We have from
Vossius the information that Blaeu undertook the measurement
of a degree on the surface of the earth to the end
that he might aid the map maker in improving his work
and serve especially the cause of navigation. In his attempts
to find a new and better method for terrestrial
measurements, it seems probable that he anticipated the
work of the great mathematician Snellius, whose results
were first published in the year 1617, and to whom credit is
generally given for having employed a new method of
procedure based upon triangulation.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Blaeu’s measurements,
made along the coast of the Netherlands from the
mouth of the Meuse to the Texel, were never published,
probably for the reason, as suggested by Vossius, that he
may have distrusted their accuracy. The mathematician
Picard, in his Voyage d’Uranibourg,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> writes in the month
of July, 1671, a brief word concerning Blaeu’s contributions
toward the solution of problems having to do with
terrestrial measurements, giving us in this word practically
the only information we have concerning the matter. According
to Picard, Blaeu’s measurements gave results with
an error of but 66 meters, whereas for the same measurements,
Snellius’s results gave an error of no less than 3880
meters. Had Blaeu more persistently carried on his studies
in this particular branch of mathematical geography, his
name doubtless would have been with the very first in a
list of those who have made contribution to the science of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
terrestrial measurement and to a reform of the maps. His
aim was set in the right direction, and we are safe in saying
that none, in his day, made greater contribution toward the
attainment of accuracy in map drawing than did he. To
be able to understand the nature of the errors so common
in chart making and to be able to correct the same were
two very different matters, and although Blaeu was able
to point out many errors, such, for example, as pertained
to latitude and longitude, his maps do not indicate that he
was able to overcome all difficulties. His was not the day
for scientifically accurate results. Years had yet to pass
before that end could be attained. To some of his errors,
and to certain improvements of his, attention will be directed
later. He appears to have been especially desirous,
at all times, of acquiring detailed geographical and astronomical
information from navigators who visited distant
regions, making request of them that their observations
should be reported to him. In a letter to W. Schickard,
dated June 24, 1634, Blaeu wrote, “When the directors of
the East India Company placed me at the head of their
department of hydrography a year ago, I requested them
to charge all pilots and masters who sailed for India to
observe all eclipses, in whatever part they might be seen,
and this has been done.”<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> His desire to be of assistance to
others in giving out such information as might come into
his possession is made evident by the further word in his
letter to Schickard assuring him that “if observations of
eclipses from India or other places on the way are sent to
me, I shall be pleased to inform you of them.”</p>

<p>The determination of longitude, particularly at sea, remained
for more than a century and a half after Blaeu’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
day a most perplexing problem, a problem, however, of the
greatest significance in the art of navigation, miscalculations
being often the cause of most serious disasters. The
rulers of the maritime states of western Europe not infrequently
offered liberal reward for its solution. Philip III
of Spain, for instance, promised an annuity of 6000
ducats to the one who would first devise a method for determining
longitude.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Numerous attempts were made in
Spain and Portugal, as a result of the promised reward,
but the problem remained unsolved. The States General
of Holland, for instance, offered a liberal reward to Plancius
should a plan he submitted prove to be of value, which
plan he had based upon the declination of the needle; and
in the records of that body, bearing date May 21, 1601, we
read that a reward of 150 pounds was promised to any one
who, having made an expedition for the purpose of determining
longitude and latitude, could obtain the support of
six or eight sea captains that his method was of real value.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
Blaeu often figured somewhat conspicuously as an expert
in passing upon the solution of certain problems which
were offered. Resolutions of the States General, for example,
make mention of a plan submitted by Thomas Leamer,
an Englishman residing in Amsterdam, but it appears that
no satisfactory agreement could be entered into with him
on his first plans, and it was, therefore, decided to submit
his subsequent propositions to the College of Admiralty
of Amsterdam, authorizing this body to ask for a demonstration
of the new invention in its presence, to have it
investigated by Willem Jansz. Blaeu and other masters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
in this art together with such experienced navigators and
pilots as the College might see fit to choose, to examine it
carefully and impartially with especial reference to its
practical value, and to follow their best judgment as to the
advisability of attempting to make use of the invention.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
On July 3, 1612, the Council of the Admiralty sent word
to the States General that the aforesaid Leamer had been
examined, in accord with the letter of December 21, 1611,
at different times, and at his request again and again in its
presence, by “Willem Jansz,” and by many other persons
experienced in mathematics and navigation, in order to
find out the truth relative to his proposition; that they had
charged the judges to examine honestly, and that it had
been unanimously concluded the invention was wholly
worthless.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> It is not without interest to note that Leamer
made an especial appeal to the Admiralty of Amsterdam,
charging the committee with partiality and with inability
to judge the case, but we are not informed that the Admiralty
altered its opinion.</p>

<p>Taking into consideration the extensive commerce and
interest in navigation of the United Provinces in this period,
it does not occasion surprise that Galileo, after having
offered in vain to Philip III his plan for a new method of
determining longitude, should decide to present the same
to the States General of the Provinces.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> This plan he
based upon his discovery in 1610 of the satellites of Jupiter
and the valuable data furnished him through a study of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
the eclipses of these satellites. Galileo himself tells us of
his negotiations with Philip of Spain, stating that the King
informed him of the many inventions which had been sent
to him, and which he had accepted, only to find afterward
that they were of no practical value. Having been so often
deceived, he had come to the conclusion that a great deal of
money had been wasted, and had, therefore, decided to be
more careful in future. It was not until August, 1636,
that Galileo decided upon presenting his plan to the States
General, as he informed Hugo Grotius, then Swedish consul
at the French Court, and not until November of that
year that Laurens Reael handed to the States a letter from
him containing an explanation of his method, with an offer
of the plan to that distinguished body. Blaeu is again
chosen as one of four experts to examine and report on the
invention. Galileo’s plan was well adapted for the determination
of longitude on land, but because of the ship’s
motion on the high seas it did not prove to be practical
for navigators, though he suggested the placing of his
instruments and the observer in a vessel of water on the
ship’s deck, thinking thus to counterbalance the ship’s motion.
By resolution of April 25, 1637, he was to receive
a reward for the new method he had suggested, but it does
not appear that it was paid to him.</p>

<p>Blaeu’s training admirably fitted him to serve his country
in matters pertaining to its maritime interests, and its
calls as well as its rewards for his services were not infrequent.
As further proof of the confidence that his contemporaries
had in his knowledge of geography and
navigation, the States General of Amsterdam, January 3,
1633, by resolution appointed Blaeu map maker of the
Republic, an honorable position held by him until his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
death, being then successively passed on to his son and to
his grandson. In a resolution of October 23, 1666, we read
that no house engaged in commerce will be allowed to send
any marine maps to India, or have them taken by captains
of vessels, except those made by Blaeu; and in a resolution
of 1670 it is stated that to Willem Jansz. Blaeu, map
maker in ordinary of the Company, instruction has been
given to examine the journals of the pilots and to correct
and improve the maps.</p>

<p>It is not easy at this date to determine the justice of the
several complaints which we find were occasionally made
by certain map makers of the Netherlands in the early
seventeenth century against fellow countrymen. There
was so much borrowing one from the other without credit
that it would be an exceedingly difficult, if not impossible,
task to give a complete catalogue of any one of the several
map makers’ work. Rivalry often ran strong, and the
authorities not infrequently were urged to exercise special
diligence to prevent the infringement of a copyrighted
plate, or one that was protected, as they at that time expressed
it, by an octroi. Between Willem Blaeu and
Joannes Janssonius this rivalry was particularly marked,
each claiming at times an infringement by the other.
Whether it was for protection against Janssonius that
Blaeu in 1608 presented a special plea to the States of
Holland and West Friesland, asking that he be made
secure against the loss caused by pirated editions of works
published by him, is not certain. He informed the States
that he had given himself hope of being able to support his
family in an honest way, and that he would have succeeded
with God’s mercy and blessing, if certain individuals engaged
in the same business had not undertaken to copy his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
new works, as well as his enlarged and improved works.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
This rivalry between Blaeu and Janssonius continued for
many years, involving in some degree Jodocus Hondius,
the father-in-law of Janssonius. It seems probable that
Blaeu’s complaint of 1608 touched in some manner his
large World Map of 1605, since, as before stated, there is a
striking resemblance between this and the World Map of
Hondius issued about 1611, on which he must have been at
work for some years, a similarity in which the very differences
and slight variations cannot be without peculiar significance.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>If Blaeu won deserved renown through his scientific attainments,
so the Blaeu press became renowned for the
excellence of the work which bore its imprint. Its map
engravers were among the most skilful employed in the
workshops of the Netherlands, its types were unexcelled in
simple but artistic form, unless perchance one may accord
first place to the Elzevir press. His good work, as we
know, was a spur to others, as, for example, to Hondius
and Janssonius in the issue of their Atlas of 1633.</p>

<p>The list of works which issued from this famous printing
house in so far as we have accurate information, is an exceedingly
long one, and the titles include many which do
not touch upon matters geographical, hence do not call for
consideration in this brief sketch. We may, therefore, pass
to a more detailed word concerning those works which bear
particularly upon geography and navigation, to his maps
and globes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p class="gtb">******</p>

<p><span class="smcap large">It</span> does not seem possible at this date to enumerate all
the maps which might properly be called the special work
of Blaeu, and it is doubtful if it could have been done in
Blaeu’s day, since he so often borrowed here a little and
there a little which he incorporated in his maps. Reference
has before been made to the practice of map makers
borrowing one from the other, sometimes more, sometimes
less, without credit. Not all of Blaeu’s maps are signed,
and but comparatively few of them are dated. He did not
consider it essential always to employ the same name when
affixing his signature. Sometimes he gave his name as
Guilielmus Janssonius Blaeu, Guil. Jansz. Blaeu, Guiljelmus
Blaeuw; sometimes as Guil. Jansz. Alcmar, Guilielmus
Janssonius Alcmarianus; sometimes as Guiljelmus
Caesius, or G. J. Caesius, in which, in accord with a practice
of the time, he had classicized his name Blaeu; sometimes
the name is coupled with that of the son as Guil. et
Johan. Blaeu, and on certain maps we find the names J. or
Joan. Blaeu, Johannes et Cornelius Blaeu, maps which
were wholly or in part the work of the sons, but were
drawn after the manner of the father.</p>

<p>Next to his terrestrial globe maps of 1599 and 1602, his
oldest known map is that of 1605, here issued in facsimile,
and described below. His “Nywe Paskaerte” of 1606, of
which but few copies are now known, appears to have been
the first which he especially designed for navigators. Baudet
gives a somewhat enthusiastic description of a copy of
this map printed on parchment, which at the time of his
writing was in the possession of Mr. Tiele.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> It is drawn
with the west at the top, having a width of 76 cm. and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
breadth of 59 cm., extending from 25° 30′ to 75° north
latitude, or from the Canary Islands on the south to the
Beeren Island on the north, from Terceira on the west to
and including the Ionian Islands on the east. In a cartouche
at the bottom of the map is the following inscription,
given here in free translation:<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> “Willem Jansz. to
the kind reader: In this map, dear reader, you will find all
the sea coasts of Europe carefully drawn by Cornelius
Doedsz. of Edam, according to true directions and elevations,
except for the Mediterranean, in which the author
has purposely omitted the elevations from Malta eastward,
and has only given direction, according to our common
Dutch compasses, which, in the vicinity of Candia and
Cyprus point a little too much toward the northwest, as is
shown by the fact that Malta, the south shore of Candia
and of Cyprus are all situated in latitude 36°, although it
is impossible to reach them sailing west-east, as this map
clearly shows.” To the right of the above inscription we
read: “Ghedruct t’ Amsterdam bij Willem Janssoon op’t
Waeter inde Sonnewijser,” and to the left, given here in
translation: “Since on account of the limited space the
entire Mediterranean Sea could not be given, we have
therefore decided, for the use of seamen, to add also the
part from the coasts of Barbary, Sicily, and Malta, passing
the Grecian Islands, Candia, and Cyprus to the coast of
Syria.” Of the two small inset maps, one represents the
Azores, the other the Beeren Island and the west coast of
Spitzbergen. The eastern part of the Mediterranean,
Greece and the Ionian Archipelago, the coast of Asia
Minor and Syria, have been placed in the Sahara Desert.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
Longitude is not indicated, but latitude is given on the
border, each degree being divided into thirds. In this map
northern Europe is brought too far to the west, and, in
accord with the general representations of the time, the
Mediterranean is given too great an extent in longitude.
The errors in latitude are comparatively insignificant. As
one of the first examples of the work of Blaeu’s printing
house, it is deserving the special mention given above, particularly
so by reason of the distinctness of its boundary
lines, the excellent form of its letters, and the care with
which geographical details have been indicated.</p>

<p>A resolution of the States General dated April 25, 1608,
gives us the information that to Willem Jansz., map maker
of Amsterdam, the sum of 200 gl. is to be given for the
dedication and presentation of a book of sea charts, entitled
“Het Licht der Zeevaert,” which lays down the coasts and
harbors of the Western, Northern and Eastern Seas. In
this we appear to have first reference to Volumes I and II
of an important work by Blaeu, of which work a third volume
appeared in 1621, protected by an octroi of the States
General for six years, expressed in a resolution bearing
date August 13, 1618.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> This resolution of the States informs
us that to Willem Jansz., a citizen of Amsterdam,
an octroi is granted for the period of six years, to make,
print, and publish in the United Netherlands, the third
part of his book entitled “Het Licht der Zeevaert,” containing
a description of the sea-coasts of the Mediterranean
Sea. Copies of the first two volumes, printed in accord
with the indication contained in the resolution referred to
above, that is, in 1608, appear not to be known, but there
exists a French edition of 1619, bearing the title “Le flambeau
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>de la navigation ... Chez Guilliaume Jeansz. demeurant
sur l’eau, à l’ensigne du Solaire Dore. l’An 1619,”
which title is often found in the volume pasted over an
original Dutch title dated 1620. In translation this Dutch
title, being practically the same as that in French, reads,
“The Light of Navigation in which are plainly drawn and
described all the Coasts and Harbours of the Western,
Northern, Eastern and Mediterranean Seas. Also many
countries, islands and places of Guinea, Brazil, East and
West Indies. Partly taken from the works of the best
writers on marine matters [as Lucas Jansz. Waghenaer
and others] but improved through the writings of experienced
seamen, and by making use of their statements and
explanations; enlarged by many new descriptions and
maps. All divided into four books, each volume having its
own index. Hereto have been added [besides a course in
the art of navigation] new tables of the declination of the
sun, derived from the observations of Tycho Brahe, and
calculated from the meridian of Amsterdam. Also new
tables and instructions in the right use of the Pole Star and
other Stars, for the benefit of all navigators.” In 1627 the
Dutch edition seems to have been issued by “Jan Janssoon
wonende op ’t water,” the first part being dated 1626, and
the second part dated 1625.</p>

<p>In the dedication of his third volume to the States General
and to Prince Maurice, a dedication dated September
1, 1618, there is to be found a statement by Blaeu which
shows his own opinion of the importance of the first two
volumes. He writes he is “assured without boasting that
this third volume will be as useful as the two preceding,
containing the description of Eastern and Western Navigation,
of which Your Honorable Body [States General]<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
and Your Excellency [Maurice] at other times have had
sufficient proof from trustworthy certificates of well known
navigators, and also from the statements of the famous
pilot Lucas Waghenaer.” To have from Lucas Jansz.
Waghenaer a favorable criticism concerning a work which
was destined to be considered superior to his own, is of no
little importance. Blaeu further acknowledges in his introduction
the influence of Willem Barentszoen’s maps
upon his own, for he states “to the kind reader” that “we
have for some years past collected very carefully all observations
and plans, by means of which we have improved
and enlarged in many respects the descriptions of Willem
Barentsz., whose writings have been of much value to us in
this work. Besides, we have added the descriptions of all
the sea-coasts in the east which were not laid down by him,
as of the islands of Candia, Cyprus, the coasts of Syria
and Egypt, and also of the Greek islands; and how one in
this way can sail even to Constantinople; and we have put
this all together.” “The uses of this Book” he sets forth in
six brief introductory chapters, in which he treats of “1—The
difference between the Dutch and the Italian marine
maps; 2—Why the compass needle is not laid directly under
the compass lily; 3—Why the marine charts of the
Mediterranean Sea are not drawn showing the degrees of
latitude; 4—How to reckon latitude; 5—How the declination
of the compass needle or the variation of the compass
may be determined; 6—How to find the elevation of the
sun from its shadow.”</p>

<p>Blaeu’s reference to the declination of the needle in this
introduction is of considerable scientific importance and
interest. In his day the compass makers found the needle’s
declination for Holland to be from about 7° 45′ to about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
8° 26′ eastward. They were, therefore, accustomed to lay
the compass lily a corresponding number of degrees to the
left or westward from the direction in which the needle
pointed that this lily might turn to the true north. He
found that in the Adriatic the declination of the needle
was 0, and that in the Italian compasses the direction of
the needle and of the lily agreed. Compass roses on Italian
portolan or sailors’ charts, therefore, indicated no declination
as the Italian compasses indicated none, and the compass
lily simply marked the true meridian. As distances
to be sailed in the Mediterranean were not great, latitude,
therefore, was not laid down, and longitude was omitted,
by reason of the fact that there was no accurate method of
determining the same, consequently vessels sailed from
port to port directed only by the compass. Blaeu wrote
that “since the skies are there [in the Mediterranean] almost
always clear, and the land high, and places are not
far distant one from another, one losing sight of one part
of the coast will be in sight of another part, and the majority
make very little use of latitude. The seamen and those
who have navigated these parts have not taken into consideration
the latitudes, and follow only general direction.”
This being Blaeu’s observation, which is practically taken
word for word from Barentszoen’s introduction to his
“Caertboeck,” one would not, therefore, expect to find
either parallels or meridians laid down on his maps. He
gives only compass roses and direction for sailing in accord
with the Dutch compass. On the maps of Barentszoen,
which maps Blaeu closely followed in many respects, the
directions for sailing are given in accord with the Dutch
and with the Italian compasses. Blaeu could not have followed
a better master in plan and purpose, and while not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
always indicating just what he borrowed, he seems to have
been inclined to give adequate praise to the work of his
predecessor. It cannot be without interest to cite here a
brief word from Barentszoen’s introduction to his “Caertboeck,”
as indicating his spirit and method. He says “that
not only being urged by my many good friends, but also
feeling inclined myself to do so, since I always have been
accustomed from my boyhood up to draw as many maps
as I found it possible to draw of the countries which I visited,
or around which I sailed, giving the seas, the waters
and the directions, I have decided to publish certain maps
of the sea-coast of the Mediterranean Seas [which I have
collected for some years past] into book form, for the use
and the benefit of all navigators, and persons interested in
navigation. In part, I describe what I myself have seen on
my journeys, in part what I have learned from other experienced
navigators and pilots, who have sailed through
the Strait of Gibraltar to Italy and the surrounding countries.
And this I have carefully arranged, showing all
harbors, roads, bays, courses and directions; giving myself
a great deal of trouble, and incurring a great deal of expense.
Since I did not like to rely alone upon myself, I
invited to my home several seamen and pilots, who sailed
the Mediterranean Seas, with whom I have communicated
about my work. I made corrections whenever I found that
their observations had been more exact than my own, that
it might not seem as if I, being proud, intended to make a
name for myself, and as if I had done this work carelessly,
but that it should be clear I had gone to much trouble.”</p>

<p>A resolution of the States General, dated March 9, 1623,
granted to Willem Jansz. Blaeu, for a period of ten years,
the exclusive right to print and publish a work referred to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
in the resolution as “een compendium van den Zeespiegel.”
It appears, however, that this was not issued until 1625,
and under the title “Tafelen van de declinatie der Sonne,
ende der voornaemste vaste sterren, Mitsgaders van ’t
verscheyden gebruyck der Noordsterre Nieulycx, allen
Zeevaerenden ten dienst, ghecalculeert door Willem
Jansz. Blauw,” or “Tables of the declination of the sun
and of the most important planets with the different uses
of the North Star calculated anew for the use of all navigators
by Willem Jansz. Blauw.” On the title-page appears
a representation of the cross-staff and the astrolabe,
with the imprint “t’ Amsterdam By Willem Jansz. Blauw
in de guide Sonnewyser, Met privilegie, Anno 1625.” The
statement is made in the preface that “from the exact
observations of Tycho Brahe, we have calculated new
tables of the declination of the sun.” These same tables
are to be found in the Zeespiegel of 1627, and were intended
to replace the old tables of the “Nieuw Graetbouck”
of the year 1605.</p>

<p>A second privilege granted by the States General, dated
March 9, 1623, as the preceding, gives us the first word
concerning another work by Blaeu intended especially for
the use of seamen. This work, apparently not issued until
the following year, though a copy dated 1624 does not
seem now to be known, bears the following title taken
from the issue of 1627: “Zeespiegel, Inhoudende een korte
Onderwysinghe in de Konst der Zeevaert, en Beschryvinghe
der Seen en Kusten van de Oostersche, Noordsche
end Westersche Schipvaert. Wt ondervindinghen van
veel ervaren Zeevaerders vergadert, en t’ samen ghestelt.
Door Willem Jansz. Blaeuw Tot Amsterdam. Ghedruckt
by Willem Jansz. Blaeuw, in de vergulde Sonnewyser<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
1627. Met Privilegie voor thien Jaren”; or, “Mirror of
the Sea, containing brief instruction in the art of Navigation,
and a description of the seas and coasts of the Eastern,
Northern and Western Navigation. Collected and
arranged from the experiences of numerous Navigators.
By Willem Jansz. Blaeuw, At Amsterdam. Printed by
Willem Jansz. Blaeuw, in the gilded Sun-dial, 1627. With
a privilege for ten years.”</p>

<p>Blaeu figures his declination tables from the years 1624,
1625, 1626 and 1627, on a parallel of the earth from the
meridian of the west point of England, since this longitude
was most frequently used by the Dutch navigators in sailing
the Channel, as well as in sailing the coasts of France,
Portugal or Spain. The work is divided into two parts,
the first being a short treatise on the art of navigation, and
the second a collection of maps or sea charts. We have in
this work a striking illustration of the lingering influence
of Ptolemy, for he takes as a basis of many of the ideas he
presents the work of Ptolemy. The book does not undertake,
as Baudet points out, to add to or improve the
methods of defining geographical location. It does not
undertake to correct what were the known errors in his
day. He treats in his first part of the several spheres; he
presents what he considers to be acceptable proof that the
earth is in the center of the universe, as the stars appear at
all times to be of the same size, in whatever part of the
heavens they may be; he explains the construction and the
use of the cross-staff by means of which the observer determines
the altitude of the sun; he points out that in determining
latitude by observing the altitude of the Pole Star,
2° 42′ should be taken as the distance from the star to the
pole; he discusses the subject of atmospheric refraction,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
basing his observations on those of Tycho Brahe, which
discussion is of special interest since it sets forth the attitude
of seamen of that day toward this subject, and the
difficulty they had in meeting it by reason of the imperfect
instruments with which they made their calculations.</p>

<p>Blaeu’s charts are drawn on a plane or cylindrical projection,
although the projection of Mercator had been
known for more than half a century. This fact seems to
suggest the idea that in publishing his book he had not so
much in view the question of the advance of the art of
navigation as to meet a desire for a work in agreement
scientifically with the knowledge of seamen of his day. In
point of accuracy, Blaeu’s charts in this work are wanting
much, but we must not forget the imperfect methods employed
in his day for obtaining geographical location. If
accuracy was wanting in the land maps, much less could
we expect to find accuracy in the marine charts. Seamen
in part were accustomed to estimate longitude and distance
from change in latitude, and the direction in which they
sailed. The speed of a ship was often estimated from the
size and the number of sails used. It was not until about
the middle of the seventeenth century that the log was
brought into common use, consequently Blaeu makes no
reference to it. It is interesting to note that a somewhat
similar instrument was employed about the middle of the
sixteenth century for measuring the angle which the axis
of the ship made with its track as observed on the surface
of the water. In his “Spieghel der Zeevaert” of 1584,
Waghenaer states that for measuring this angle, “it is necessary
to let the plumb line log behind with a piece of wood
attached or otherwise.” A comparison of the maps of
Blaeu with those of his distinguished predecessors, Lucas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
Jansz. Waghenaer and Willem Barentszoen, warrants our
assigning to him first place, both in point of execution
and in the nearer approach to correctness in his drawing.
John Blaeu, in his Atlas of 1664, referring to the maps of
Waghenaer and Barentszoen, says that “my late father
not only greatly improved both of these, but also enlarged
them for the benefit of navigation, adding to them so much
that was lacking that his may justly be called a new work.”</p>

<p>In 1646, John Blaeu printed a fourth part of the Zeespiegel,
bearing the title “Vierde deel der Zeespiegel, inhoudende
eene beschryvinge der See-havenen, Reeden, en
Kusten van de Middelandsche Schipvaert. Uyt ondervindingen
van vele ervaren Zeevaerders by een vergadert,
en t’ samengestelt, door Willem Jansz. Blaeu, t’ Amsterdam.
Gedruckt by Johan Blaeu, op ’t Water, in de vergulde
Zonnewyser. 1646,” or “Fourth Part of the Mirror
of the Sea, containing a description of the Harbors, Roadsteads,
and Coasts of the Mediterranean Navigation.
Collected from the experiences of famous Navigators, and
arranged by Willem Jansz. Blaeu at Amsterdam. Printed
by John Blaeu on the Water in the gilded Sun-dial, 1646.”
There is included in this fourth part the third part of the
“Licht der Zeevaert” of 1621, with the arrangement of the
contents and the size of the volume somewhat altered. That
which is true of certain map publishers in this day, in their
attitude toward their own publications, was true of the
publishers of these Willem Blaeu maps after his death. So
long as there were publishers for them, it was not thought
to be necessary to improve them, especially so since John
Blaeu, who had succeeded his father in charge of the business,
had taken up what he thought to be more profitable
printing than the issue of charts for seamen. Other publishers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
after the middle of the century, were entering the
field, and the Blaeu marine maps in course of time came to
be regarded as obsolete.</p>

<p>What we may call his first Atlas of land maps appeared
in 1631, with the title “Appendix Theatri Ortelii et Atlantis
Mercatoris.” It contains maps which had been previously
issued, some by himself, many by other map makers,
while in numerous instances he left it difficult to decide
both date and origin. We know that as early as 1605 he
was issuing maps and charts in single sheets, following the
example of Ortelius, Mercator, Judeus and others. Baudet,
it may be noted, expresses himself as being unable to
decide whether the World Map of 1605, referred to in the
resolution of the States General of the 23d of April of
that year, was of this character, not knowing of the existence
of a copy of the map here reproduced in facsimile
from that belonging to the Hispanic Society of America.
“My belief,” he says, “is that the World Map of 1605 is
the Nova totius terrarum orbis geographica ac hydrographica
tabula, auct. Guiljelmo Blaeuw,” according to Mercator’s
projection, to be found in the “Toonneel des
Aerdrycx.”<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Not unlike Ortelius, Blaeu often selected
for addition to his own original land maps the best which
he found it possible for him to use, redrafting them on a
scale to fit his own Atlas. In general, he greatly improved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
their character by his own re-engraving, giving us maps of
superior excellence in line, in letter, and in ornamentation.
He was not unmindful of the high favor in which the
Atlases of Ortelius and of Mercator were held. He, therefore,
shrewdly calls attention to their work by giving to his
own a title which suggests a connection, though in fact he
was scarcely justified in calling his Atlas an Appendix to
Ortelius and Mercator. This Atlas of 1631 contains one
hundred and three maps, with text in Latin usually printed
on the back of each. Seven of his maps are dated, twenty-seven
have the names of the original maker, and many of
them are signed Guilj. Blaeu, G. J. Caesius or Guiljelmus
Janssonius et Joannes Blaeu.</p>

<p>He begins his preface with much praise of Ortelius and
Mercator, observing that Mercator died untimely for his
work, after finishing Europe except Spain, and he assumes
it as his task to publish an Appendix to the Atlases
of these great men. He states that his Atlas will contain
maps of countries already drawn by them, but he promises
to improve them. That he did improve not a few of them
is made evident by a close comparison, yet he left many
features uncorrected, which easily could have been brought
to date.</p>

<p>He often intimated to his friend, W. Schickard, his ever
present desire to improve his maps, in which references we
find the first promises of his work issued in 1634 under the
title “Toonneel des Aerdrycx.” In a letter dated Amsterdam,
November 22, 1633, he tells his friend of his preparation
for this new Atlas,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> expressing the hope that he
would be able to complete the first part during the winter,
and accepting from him an offer for a new map of Würtemberg,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
for which he was ready and willing to pay the
price asked. This map he thought would add much to his
maps of Germany. December 6, 1633, he writes again to
Schickard: “The esteemed gentleman, Hugo Grotius, has
informed you that I am planning a new Atlas, and that a
considerable part of it is already completed, in addition to
my Appendix Theatri Ortelii et Atlantis Mercatoris,
which has been published, so that I will be able to issue yet
this winter two parts of reasonable size, one part of which
will contain maps of upper and lower Germany, and as I
should like to add this map of Würtemberg which you
have drawn, and which you have promised me, I therefore
wish to postpone the publication a little longer. You
write that this map of Würtemberg which you have drawn
on twenty sheets can be reduced to four of common size.
If, however, you deem it better to make use of more sheets,
you may follow your pleasure. Whatever your decision, I
will pay the price which you ask for it.” On January 12,
1634, Blaeu writes Schickard again: “I am pleased to
learn you agree with my opinion in regard to the number
of maps. It is my intention to place two or three provinces
on one sheet, but it will be necessary, however, to leave some
open space in which I can write the titles of the maps, arms
of the country, and the scale of miles. Do not let this worry
you, however, but follow the divisions which are most easy
for you. In the case of maps so carefully drawn, it seems
to me the larger the number, the better it will be. Forests,
buildings, etc., may be but roughly marked. If you will
give the size and exact location, I will take care that the
emblematical figures are properly represented”; and he
adds that “in order to make sure that the completed work
is well done, I shall let you correct the plates one at a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
time.” Somewhat later Blaeu writes again that “I shall
give especial attention to the engraving of the plates,
printing lightly from them at first, in order that changes
may be made before the final engraving is done.... Take
as much time as you may need, and in case you are unable
to finish them during the summer, you may also have
the winter.” June 24, 1634, he writes to Schickard: “I
have published the first part of my Atlas, containing one
hundred and sixty maps, with descriptive text in German,
translated from Latin. In the Fall I shall publish
the Latin, French and Dutch texts,” these titles being, respectively,
“Theatrum Orbis Terrarum,” but dated 1635;
“Le théâtre du monde ou nouvel atlas,” but issued in 1634;
“Toonneel des Aerdrycx,” 1634. The arrangement and
number of maps in the several issues do not agree, but in
the main features they are the same. The “Toonneel” may
be considered an enlargement of his “Appendix” done in
practically the same manner, but with the addition of
numerous details, and ornamented with additional illustrations.
That he borrowed from the “Nieuwen Atlas”
of Joannes Janssonius and Henricus Hondius becomes
evident in a comparison of the descriptions of “Germany,”
the “Netherlands,” and of certain other parts.</p>

<p>The “Appendix” and the first two parts of the “Toonneel,”
published by Willem Blaeu and his son John, may
be regarded as the beginning of the large Blaeu Atlas first
issued in 1662 in eleven volumes, a work of unsurpassed
excellence; indeed, we may refer to it as the foremost atlas
produced by the great Dutch atlas makers of the seventeenth
century. Its completion and issue, after the death
of the father, Willem, places it therefore without the scope
of this sketch, yet as he had contributed so much to insure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
its success by his own early activities, a word of reference
to it is here fitting. Editions of this work appeared in
rapid succession in the Dutch, the French, the Latin and
the Spanish language, the number of volumes being either
nine, ten, eleven or twelve in each edition, varying otherwise
but little in the essential features. As numerous copies
of the work were printed in each edition, it is therefore not
a publication which can be called rare even in this day.
Most of these editions were printed from the superior type
and copper plates of the Blaeu printing house, and on
paper of fine quality; some were issued in costly bindings,
having their maps, coat of arms and emblems of states and
of royalty exquisitely colored. Copies of the atlas were
especially prepared for rulers and for statesmen of renown.
We are informed that to Admiral de Ruyter an
especially fine copy was presented after the two days’ battle
of 1666, and that in the name of the States General a
copy bound in royal purple was presented to the Sultan
Mohammed IV, with which he was so well pleased that he
ordered its translation into the Turkish language.</p>

<p class="gtb">******</p>

<p>In Blaeu’s day globes were held to be of the highest
value as aids in the study of geography and astronomy.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
Seamen engaged in transoceanic navigation counted on a
terrestrial and a celestial globe as essential to a navigator’s
complete outfit of instruments, and as Blaeu was especially
desirous of making his scientific knowledge serve the cause
of navigation, it was but natural that he should turn his
attention to globe making.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>Among those skilled in the art of globe construction in
the late sixteenth and the early seventeenth century, the
Low Countries could claim such distinguished men as Gerhardus
Mercator, Jacobus [Florentius] van Langren and
Arnoldus [Florentius] van Langren, father and son,
Jodocus Hondius and Guilielmus Jans. Blaeu, and none
of these was more skilful than the last named. Both for
the number constructed and for the quality of the work, his
globes are cartographical and astronomical treasures of
the first value.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="f6">
<img src="images/fig6.jpg" alt="globes">
<p class="caption">Terrestrial Globe and Celestial Globe, 1616. Willem Janszoon Blaeu</p>
</div>

<p>The oldest known terrestrial globe extant is that constructed
by Martin Behaim of Nuremberg in the year in
which Columbus made his first momentous voyage across
the Atlantic.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> It is a manuscript globe, that is, a ball covered
with irregular strips of parchment on which the world
map has been drawn by hand and elaborately colored. In
the first decades of the sixteenth century, numerous globes
were made either of copper on which the map was engraved,
of wood, or of a composition on which an engraved or hand
drawn map was pasted. Some of these globe maps, as for
example that attributed to Martin Waldseemüller and
supposed to have been drawn in the first decade of the sixteenth
century, hence the oldest known of this character,
were engraved and printed on gores or bi-angles, and were
so fashioned mathematically that they would completely
cover a ball when pasted over its surface,<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> but not until
Mercator, in 1541, engraved and printed his famous globe
gore map can such a method be said to have proved itself to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>be thoroughly practical. From this time on, with now and
then a slight modification of the number of gores employed
and of the method of fitting them on the ball near the poles,
globes have been constructed in much the same manner as
Mercator had constructed his first example. That he made
many globes is very certain, yet it appears that all of these
were long thought to have been destroyed, until about forty
years ago, when a complete set of his gores was found, and
at present no less than six others, either mounted or unmounted,
can be located.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> In 1551, Mercator prepared in
the same manner a celestial globe map, all examples of
which likewise had been thought to have disappeared until
the discovery of the set referred to above, and of this globe
a number of copies are now known to exist.</p>

<p>Quite as successful as Mercator were the van Langrens,
father and son, the first globe of the father dating as early
as 1585.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Before the close of the sixteenth century,
Jodocus Hondius became interested in the construction of
globes, and, like the van Langrens, continued his work in
the first decade of the following century, his workshop then
falling into the hands of his sons, who for many years
found the manufacture of globes to be a profitable business.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>Blaeu, as before stated, must have obtained much of his
early knowledge of map and of globe construction while a
pupil of Tycho at the Castle of Uranienburg, for it was
not long after his return to Amsterdam that we find him
actively engaged in this work, perhaps in his own workshop.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span><a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
His first globe is dated 1599. The world map
here represented is, so far as we have definite knowledge,
his first cartographical publication, and in many of its
features it gives evidence that Mercator was the master
followed, notably in the representation of the loxodrome
lines which radiate from the wind or compass roses, or from
the centers regularly placed on the surface of the globe. It
has a diameter of 34 cm., which is less than that of Mercator’s
globe of 1541 but greater than that of van Langren
of 1585. The gores, twelve in number, have been cut seven
degrees from each pole, the polar space being covered with
a circular disc. Blaeu, as many other globe makers of his
period, found that by thus dividing the engraved globe
maps a more nearly perfect covering for the ball could be
obtained. Meridians and parallels are drawn at intervals
of ten degrees, the prime meridian crossing the island of
Santa Maria in the Azores group. In conspicuously placed
legends he presents his address to the reader, that is, to the
one who may have occasion to make use of his globe, a
dedication to the United Provinces of the Netherlands,
which, like the first, is signed Guilielmus Janssonius Alcmariensis,
and in separate inscriptions he calls attention to the
great discoveries and explorations as, for example, those
of Christopher Columbus, of Amerigo Vespucci, of Ferdinand
Magellan, of Gaspar Cortereal, and of the Dutch
navigators, with a brief mention of others. All legends are
in Latin except those referring to the discoveries of his
own countrymen in the far north, in which he has employed
the Dutch language.</p>

<p>As in the issue of his sheet maps, Blaeu was not always
careful to add an exact date, in the majority of instances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
omitting the date altogether, so in the issue of his globes he
either omitted the date or frequently gave one later than
was that of the original issue. His geographical records
serve us, however, as very accurate guides in the determination
of dates, and what was so frequently true of the globes
he constructed in the last years of his life was true of this,
his first. We have, for example, one fine copy of his work,
bearing date 1599, which contains geographical records of
1616, indicating, therefore, a late reprint with a few alterations.</p>

<p>Three years later, that is, in 1602, Blaeu issued a terrestrial
and a celestial globe, each having a diameter of 23 cm.
He refers to his terrestrial globe as an improvement upon
that of 1599, referring doubtless to its geographical details
and not to its size. He dedicates his work to the three
provinces, Holland, Zeeland and West Friesland, calls
especial attention to the recent expedition of Olivier van
der Noort, the course of whose expedition around the world
he lays down on his map, and signs himself Guilielmo Jansonio
Blaeu, substituting his family name for the name of
his birthplace. On his celestial globe of 1602 he located
the stars in accord with the reckoning of the year 1600,
making use, as he states, of the observations of his friend
and teacher, Tycho Brahe, but for the southern constellations
the observations of the explorer Fredrik Houtman.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
By reason of the fact that so few copies of these globes of
1602 are known to exist, it has been thought that for some
reason Blaeu issued a very limited number. We know,
however, that his terrestrial globes were highly valued and
much in demand, because of the care with which they had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
been prepared, because of his effort to give information
concerning the latest discoveries, and because of his representation
of the loxodrome lines which made them of special
service to navigators; that his celestial globes found
favor by reason of the fact that he was known to be a pupil
and friend of Tycho Brahe; and that he himself was known
to be a mathematician and astronomer of distinction.</p>

<p>In 1603, he undertook the preparation of a celestial
globe to be considered a companion of his first globe of
1599. From the observations of Brahe and of Houtman
he tells us as in his work of the preceding year, that he derived
many of his details, and he honors the former by
giving his portrait a conspicuous position in his map,
adding his master’s favorite motto: “Non haberi, sed esse.”</p>

<p>The Hispanic Society of America possesses a fine example
of Blaeu’s early globe work. It is small in size, having
a diameter of 13 cm., and is well preserved. Near the upper
part of North America is the legend inscribed in a neat
cartouche, “NOVA et accurata Terra marisque Sphera,
denuo recognita et, correcta á Guilielmo Blaeu,” and in a
second legend placed to the south of “Nova Guinea,” which
is represented as a part of the great south polar continent
of “Magallanica,” he inscribes his name with date, “Guilielmus
Blaeu Anno D. 1606.” There may likewise be
found in this Society’s rich collections a terrestrial and a
celestial globe by Blaeu which clearly are companion pieces
and which appear to be unique, the latter dated 1616, the
former undated.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> These globes have a diameter of but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
10 cm., a substantial and artistic mounting of brass, including
meridian circle, horizon circle, four twisted support
columns and a circular base plate. In geographical
and astronomical details they are remarkably full, a fact
especially noteworthy when their size is taken into consideration.
The first he designates as “NOVA ORBIS
TERRARVM DESCRIPTIO” and adds to this merely
the name “Blaeu”; the second he calls a “Sphaera stellata,”
and in a legend he honors his teacher Tycho Brahe by making
special mention of his name, signing himself “Guilielmus
Blaeu Auctor excudit 1616.” Fiorini refers to a Blaeu
celestial globe in the Barberini Palace at Rome dated 1616,
but his description of the same shows conclusively that it is
very different from the one referred to above, and he appears
to consider its map a print of later date, though perhaps
in its main features it was originally engraved in the
year designated.</p>

<p>The next dated and signed globes of Blaeu appear to
be of the year 1622, numerous copies of which the author
has been able to locate, but in which, however, slight variations
appear. From this time until his death in the year
1638, our globe maker seems to have applied himself most
diligently to this work, the globes of his later years being
much larger than were those of his early years. This Society
possesses a well preserved example of his 1622 terrestrial
globe which has a diameter of 69 cm. Its map
gives us excellent proof of Blaeu’s superior merit in this
field. Its geographical details are most numerous, making
it an object of great scientific value. Among the records
of special interest, omitting for obvious reasons at this time
any extended reference to the work, is the representation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
of Manhattan as an island, apparently the earliest on a
dated map.</p>

<p>Vossius tells us that in addition to terrestrial and
celestial globes, Blaeu also made a planetarium and a
tellurium. In the first, the sun is placed in the center of the
system, about which revolve Venus, the Earth and the
Moon, Mars and Jupiter. The second represents the double
motion of the Earth, that is, its daily rotation and its
annual revolution. He remarks that nothing like it has been
seen since the time of Archimedes. Blaeu himself refers
to these instruments in his work first issued probably in
1620 with the title, “Tweevoudigh onderwys van de
Hemelsche en Aerdsche Globen,” as of value for the study
of cosmography. In connection with his description of
them, he interestingly observes that the celestial heavens
are at least 20,000 times greater in diameter than is the
circle of the terrestrial globe’s course, and this in his planetarium
is 2½ inches. He adds that the diameter of the
terrestrial globe’s course is 1142 times the celestial globe’s
diameter.</p>

<p>A very considerable number of his globes, doubtless constructed
subsequent to 1622, can now be located, though at
the time of writing his biography in 1872, Baudet could
find trace of but five or six, including those of earlier date.
In a searching study of the history of early globes, it may
here be stated that the author of this monograph has now
been able to locate no less than sixty Blaeu globes.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c2">WORLD MAP OF 1605</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">Among</span> the treasures of The Hispanic Society of America
may be found a unique copy of Willem Janszoon Blaeu’s
engraved World Map in two large hemispheres, issued in
the year 1605. Stretching across its upper border is the
title, “<span class="smcap">NOVA UNIVERSI TERRARUM ORBIS
MAPPA EX OPTIMIS QUIBUSQUE GEOGRAphicis
hydrographicisque tabulis summâ industriâ accuratissimè
delineata, duobus planispheriis graphicè
depicta à Guliel Janssonio Alcmar</span>,” a title which in
its special arrangement and in the form of its letters strikingly
recalls the World Map of Jodocus Hondius of the
year 1611, which, with Professor Joseph Fischer, the editor
of this World Map of Blaeu recently issued in facsimile.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
Here is a second fine example of Holland’s contribution to
the cartography of a period particularly rich in this field of
geography. Mounted on the coarse linen so frequently
used for such purposes at that early day, and attached to a
rough wooden frame, it is not a little surprising that it
should have come down to us through these many years.
The old mounting has not been disturbed for this reproduction,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
and with all of its suggestions of age, it hangs on the
walls of The Hispanic Society’s Museum amidst other rich
cartographical material of the period.</p>

<p>No reference to this great work of Blaeu appears in the
literature of cartography, and it seems probable that we
have here the only copy extant. In the records of the
States General of Amsterdam may be found, however, the
entry, “23 April 1605. Is W. Jansz. [Blaeu] van Alcmaer,
ende Herman Alartsz, die de heren Staten gepresenteert
hebben een grote Werelts Caerte, voor een gratuiteyt
toegelegt 25 gl.,” and of the same date, “Id. Is W. Jz. van
Alcmaer, wonende te Amsterdam, geaccordeert octroy,
voor den tyt van 6 jaren etc. te mogen doen drukken ende
vuyt geven een groote mappam mundi in twee ronden, by
hem yerst uitgegeven.” These passages are cited by Baudet
in his “Leven en werken van Willem Jansz. Blaeu”
without comment other than a very brief word which would
seem to indicate that the author had no definite knowledge
of the map or maps to which reference is made in the above

<p>Curiously and somewhat vexatiously, one finds in the
reference to the copyright privilege, granted by the authorities,
appearing on sheet thirteen, the date “23 April ——,”
the numbers designating the year wanting because
of the injured condition of the map. Some wonder is occasioned
by the appearance of the French lilies in the
elaborately engraved cartouche on sheets thirteen and fourteen,
and by the dedication to Henry IV of France, which
reads, “Serenissimo Christianissimo ac potentissimo D. D.
Henrico IIII Franciae et Navarre Regi. Domino suo ... entissimo
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>hanc Universi orbis terrarum Mappam I. M. Q.
dat di ... dedicat.” Close examination, however, discloses
the fact that both the lilies and the dedication were skilfully
pasted on the map after its completion, though by whom
and on what particular occasion remain matters of conjecture.
The attachment of the coat of arms and the dedication
must have occurred before 1610, the date of King
Henry’s death, and the fact serves at least to fix the time
when the map was engraved as prior to that year, or in all
probability in 1605.</p>

<p>The map is 244 × 134 cm. in size, including the border.
The two large hemispheres, each 116 cm. in diameter, present
the world, as then known, in stereographic projection.
An ornamental border surrounds it, and all available space
outside the great hemispheres and within this border is filled
with pictures of cities, rulers in martial array, representations
of the typical races of men, while in the angles formed
at the top and at the bottom of the map, between the two
hemispheres, appear the north and the south celestial hemispheres,
each 26 cm. in diameter.</p>

<p>The map is not well preserved, a fact easily recognized
in the reproduction. Certain parts, it will be noted, are
entirely wanting, having fallen away from the old mounting,
but there is little missing that is of the first importance
excepting the northwest section of South America, the
western Mediterranean lands and portions of the island
region southeast of Asia. Though many of the names are
illegible by reason of discoloration, it was thought inadvisable
to attempt the cleaning of the surface on account of
the brittle condition of the old paper. The eighteen sheets
in the facsimile, corresponding to the eighteen sheets of the
original, together with the key plate much reduced but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
showing the entire map, have been printed on a fine quality
of Van Gelder hand-made paper. Care has been exercised
to have each of the sheets appear in the reproduction as in
the original, in so far as has been possible, no attempt being
made to remedy defects.</p>

<p>Blaeu’s map may be considered a remarkably excellent
record of geographical knowledge to date. Most of his
striking errors in continental outlines are the common
errors of the day. In the Old World, for example, Africa
has a breadth of more than eighty degrees, and the east coast
of Asia, particularly its northern half, is far from accurate,
but he has given us a representation of the extreme northeast
section which is superior to that laid down on the large
world map of his fellow countryman Hondius. The latter
clearly suited his representation to a belief in a perfectly
open sea route to China and the distant Orient, showing a
great breadth of sea between Asia and America in the region
of Bering Strait, while Blaeu has here a fairly
accurate record of the geographical features of the region,
inserting the name “Streto de Anian.” The Mediterranean
has much too great an extension in longitude, and is too
narrow; the Caspian Sea and the Black Sea have each a
strikingly erroneous representation as well as location.
The great austral continental land called “Magallanica,”
in the New World hemisphere, is that which so commonly
appears in the world maps of the day. In the New
World, North America is made to extend through more
than one hundred and sixty degrees of longitude, while
South America is given a breadth of more than sixty degrees,
and its general outline is not well done, though there
is here clearly an improvement over the maps of Mercator
and of Ortelius. Blaeu has retained the erroneous representation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
of the “Martin Forbischers Strate” at the southern
extremity of Greenland; he includes “Frislandia”
south of “Islandia”; “I dos Demonios” east of “Terra de
Labrador”; “Brasil” west of “Hibernia al Yrlandia,” “As
Mann” to the southwest; “S. Brandan” near “C. d. Breton.”
For the region north of Europe and Asia, the map
is especially interesting, making record here of the latest
attempts under Willem Barentszoen and other less distinguished
explorers from Holland who undertook to find a
northeast passage to China before 1605. That part of
“Nova Zemla” which was visited is laid down, as are also
“Nieuland” and “Beeren Eylandt,” the names of all places
designated being in the Dutch language, though an extensive
legend north of Nova Zemla, calling attention to the
efforts of his countrymen to find a northeast passage, is
given in Latin, as are all the more lengthy legends. A
comparison of the maps of Hondius and Blaeu in this particular
region is interesting, the latter preparing his map
before the voyage of Henry Hudson, the former making
record of Hudson’s attempt to sail through this Arctic sea
and noting that he had discovered a great ice barrier,
“Glacies ab Hudsono detect anno 1608.” Finding it impossible
to make this passage, it will be recalled that Hudson
decided to turn his expedition to the west and the
northwest, reaching in due course of sailing the east coast
of North America, which he explored in his two voyages
from Hudson River to Hudson Bay, losing his life in this
great northern sea, which bears his name, in the year 1611.
Blaeu has inscribed numerous legends in the northern and
northeastern sections of North America, calling attention
in one of these to the expeditions of Columbus, Vespucci,
Cortereal and Verrazano, in another to the expedition of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
Forbischer in 1577, and in yet another to the explorations
of Davis in 1585, 1586, 1587. Numerous legends, it may
here be noted, appear in different parts of the map, either
descriptive of the region in which they respectively appear
or calling attention to certain astronomical and geographical
questions, as, for example, the lengthy legend on sheets
fourteen-fifteen, sheet seventeen and sheet eighteen. In a
map of this character one may say the particular scientific
and historical value lies in the latest records it contains
relative to exploration and discovery. Without giving
here the numerous specific references to such events, or to
their results as they relate to the expansion of geographical
knowledge, it may be stated that Blaeu’s map is one
of the richest of the period. His geographical names in
the Old World alone extend into the thousands, and for the
New World those both of coast and of interior are exceedingly
numerous.</p>

<p>Blaeu has called especial attention to the four distinguished
explorers who prior to the time of the issue of his
map had circumnavigated the globe, placing their portraits
in an elaborate cartouche south of South America and calling
attention to their success in a somewhat elaborate legend.
The four represented are “Ferdinandus Magallanes,”
“Franciscus Dracus,” “Thomas Candish” and “Oliverus
van der Nort,” the course of the latter being conspicuously
traced on the map, his circumnavigation at this time attracting
considerable attention, particularly in the Netherlands.
The artistic adornment of Blaeu’s map is not its
least attractive feature. Its elaborate border, so much of
it at least as remains, there being evidence that at both top
and bottom much has been cut away, alone gives it almost
first place among the fine examples of copper engraving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
of the period. On the right and the left we find representations
of “London,” “Hamburgh,” “Mexico,” “Cusco,”
“Dantzik,” “Moskow,” “Bergen,” “Stockholm,” alternating
with representations of typical people of the earth,
such as “Groenlandi,” “Chilienses et Peruviani,” “Brasilienses,”
“Moscovitae,” “Chinenses et Japonenses.” The
“Rex Hispania,” “Imperator Romanorum,” “Imperator
Turcarum” and “Rex Chinarum” appear in martial array
and are given places of special prominence near the top of
the map, while the “Rex Abissinorum,” “Rex Persearum,”
“Magnus Cham Tartarorum” and “Magnus Dux Moscoviae”
command in corresponding positions at the bottom.
In his representations of the celestial hemispheres he gives
special credit to Tycho Brahe and to Frederik Houtman
for his information. Parallels and meridians are drawn at
intervals of ten degrees, the prime meridian passing
through the islands of “S. Michiel” and “S. Maria.” Compass
roses are numerous, two of these being especially conspicuous
by reason of the fact that with them appear the
Dutch names of the thirty-two compass points or directions,
and the radiating lines serve as loxodrome lines. No less
than thirty ships are represented sailing the oceans in all
parts of the world, carrying either the pennant of Spain,
of Portugal, of Holland or of England. A few of these
are curiously interesting, there having been an attempt to
fashion them after the manner of the countries to which
they belong, as, for example, a Japanese vessel off the coast
of Japan, “Navis qua Japonenses utuntur quae illis Champan
dicitur,” and an open boat in the Pacific near the Strait
of Magellan, “Huiusmodi navicularunt forma freti magellaniei
accolis in usu est.” Sea monsters are numerous, and
Neptune is represented in certain parts carrying either a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
trident, a pennant of Spain or one of Portugal. Blaeu has
not omitted the representation of numerous land animals
thought to be native to the regions in which they appear, as
in Africa the lion, the tiger, the elephant, the camel, the
ostrich, the crocodile; in South America the llama, the
alpaca, the monkey, the armadillo, the parrot; in North
America the bison, the opossum which is curiously fashioned,
the fox and the bear.</p>

<p>Reference has been made to the striking similarity in
arrangement and style of the descriptive titles of the
Blaeu and the Hondius large World Maps. This similarity
is further traceable literally in hundreds of details,
forcing upon us the suggestion that Hondius
borrowed extensively from Blaeu, since the map of
the latter is of the earlier date. To but a few of the more
striking evidences of borrowing, however, can attention
here be directed. The fact is exceedingly interesting
that many of the objects otherwise similarly drawn
are reversed in position as represented on the maps. Blaeu
turns the faces of his portraits of Magellan and Drake to
their left, of Van der Noort and Candysch to their right;
Hondius has reversed the position. Most of Blaeu’s ships
sail in a direction opposite to that in which the ships of
Hondius are made to sail, the location of the several ships
being, however, practically the same on the two maps; the
most ornamental compass roses are placed in identically
the same positions; the dedications of the maps and the
addresses to the reader are similarly placed in ornamental
cartouches, which, however, in the details of their decorations
differ slightly; each has a somewhat elaborate representation
of the cannibals in eastern South America, but in
their details the pictures are reversed. The line of the ecliptic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
passes south of the equator in the western hemisphere,
and northward in the eastern hemisphere on the Blaeu map,
and this Hondius has reversed; the position of Blaeu’s griffin
and tiger in the heart of Africa has been reversed by
Hondius. Not to extend such comparisons further, it may
be stated that a study of the two maps with these similarities,
even in minute details in view, can not fail to interest.
May there not, therefore, have been good reason for
Blaeu’s complaint expressed to the States General in 1608?
In this, as before stated, he prayed for protection against
those who were taking from his work without credit.</p>

Utrechtsch genootschap van kunsten

<p>August 8, 1576, the corner-stone of
the Castle of Uranienburg was laid
with much ceremony, and the completion
of the building was made possible
through the generous contributions
and patronage of Frederick II of
Denmark. See, for a brief description,
Wolf: <i>Geschichte der Astronomie,
München, 1877, p. 277</i>; Picard, J.
<i>Voyage d’Uranibourg, ou observations
astronomiques faites en Dannemarck.
(Mem. de l’Acad. royale des sciences
depuis 1666 jusque à 1699, tom.
VII, p. 197)</i>; Blaeu: <i>Atlas Major,
vol. I, pp. 61-101</i>. Twelve illustrations
of the Island of Hveen, and of
the observatory of Uranienburg, with
brief description, may here be found.
These illustrations, it appears, were
taken from Brahe: <i>Astronomiae instauratae
mechanica. 1598.</i></p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[4]</a> This great copper globe, which
Picard describes as having a diameter
of 4 feet 7 inches and 1 line, constructed
in Augsburg under the direction
of Paul Hainzel, appears to have
been sent to Uranienburg about 1584.
In the course of succeeding years
more than one thousand stars were
represented on its surface according
to the observations of Tycho Brahe.
In 1597 the great astronomer left Denmark
to find a home in Prague, taking
with him his astronomical instruments,
including his celestial globe. After
Brahe’s death in 1601, these instruments
were purchased by Rudolph II,
but on the capture of the City of
Prague in 1623 by the Danish Prince
Ulrich the globe with other objects of
interest was taken to Copenhagen.
Here it remained until 1728, when it
was destroyed by fire together with
the castle in which it had so long been
kept.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">[5]</a> John Blaeu, son of Willem, tells
us that in 1591 his father was amanuensis
of Tycho Brahe. See Blaeu: <i>Atlas
Major, 1662, vol. I, p. 63</i>.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="label">[7]</a> On the title-page of many of the
books published by Blaeu, as on many
of the maps which he issued, appears
the expression “Sub signo solarii deaurati.”
Most of the works printed by
Blaeu before 1619 have as his printer’s
device a balance with a terrestrial
globe in the right scale and a celestial
globe in the left, the latter being represented
as the heavier and having the
word “Praestat” printed below it. In
certain later publications this mark
was replaced by an armillary sphere,
at the left of which is an allegorical
figure representing Time and on the
right a figure representing Hercules
with the inscription “Indefessus
agendo.” See p. 59.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_26" href="#FNanchor_26" class="label">[26]</a> Baudet says: “I am unable to determine
whether the <i>World Map</i> of
1605 and the <i>Mappa Mundi</i>, in two
hemispheres, of that year, as referred
to in the resolution of the States
General, are the same. I believe, however,
that the <i>World Map</i> is the ‘Nova
totius terrarum orbis geographica ac
hydrographica tabula, auct. Guiljelmo
Blaeuw,’ drawn according to Mercator’s
projection, to be found in the
‘Toonneel des Aerdrycx.’ It is not
dated, but apparently was printed
from a plate which had been used in
1606, though improved somewhat, but
from it the date had been erased, which
however, according to Lelewel, is
slightly visible “on some copies.” See
Baudet, <i>pp. 85-86</i>. The “Nova totius
terrarum” is reproduced, <i>p. 52</i>.</p>
